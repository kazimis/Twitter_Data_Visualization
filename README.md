For visualizing top-100 most frequent word python wordcloud library is used. The word frquency
is used to create these wordclouds. The size of each words corresponds to its frequency. The
higher frequency the larger the image of word. The color of each word corresponds to its frequency
as well. The word with close frequency tends to have about same color. As we can see in gure
4 "get" is the most frequent and "like" is the second most frequent. "Go", "say", "love" and
"people" have about the same color and hence have almost the same frquency. Likewise in
gure 5 word covid is the most frequent and the words "wave", "ready", "bed", "somwehere",
"stretch", "lay" and "outt" are close to each other interms of frequency and almost have the
same color. The same is true with the rest of words.
